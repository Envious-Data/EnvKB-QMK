# Envious Keyboards
Various RP2040 based keyboard designs intended to be reasonably affordable without sacrificing quality.

## Setup
This code is not meant to be used with the upstream branch of QMK just yet as RP2040 support is still work in progress.

As of writing this karlk90's fork with the feature/raspberry-pi-rp2040-support branch is what you should be using this with.
